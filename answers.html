<h1>
	Provide answers to the following AngularJS questions.
</h1>
<p>
    1. How do you define an AngularJS application? You define an AngularJS application by creating a module. var app= angular.module("myApp", []) -Then you add ng-app="myApp" to the html tag you want to bind it to. /
</p>
<p>2. What is a controller? -Controllers control the data of AngularJS applications -They are regular JavaScript Objects -They contain most of the logic for manipulating the UI
</p>
<p>
    3. What does ng-model do? -It is a directive that binds the value of HTML controls(input, select, textarea) to application data.
</p>
<p>
    4. What is interpolation markup? -Interpolation is a way to get data displayed in the view -Most common use is to display some data from a property that is set in the component class
</p>
<p>
    5. What is $scope? -Scope is the part of the application that allows you to manipulate data and make changes to the user interface. It is the bindng part between HTML(view) and JavaScript(controller). -Every controller, directive, and view can have its own scope.
</p>
<p>
    6. What is dependency injection? - When I create multiple files and connect them to the DOM and the files start to depend on one another to perform events on the view, this is dependency injection. When I have a factory and it sends a task to the controller, the controller is dependent on the factory in order for the functions to work.
</p>
<p>
    7. What is two-way binding? -Two way binding can both change and display the value of the variable -An example in angular is when the ng-model directive changes the model and the view in a synchronized way. When the model changes the view changes automatically. 8. What is 'controller as' syntax? -The controller as syntax gives controller an alias that acts like the scope which binds the dependencies. -For example: By using 'controller as vm', we are binding everything controlled by the controller with vm. This allows for better organization while using angular.

9. What is MV* architecture? -MV* is Model View Whatever -This is taken from the idea that you can use whatever framework you prefer because MVC, MVP, and MVVW although different, are structured in similar patterns. Model and View Each architecture has a model and view component Model -the model represents the data/information the page deals with. Examples:phone numbers, names, etc -does not hold the behaviors or services that manipulate the data/info -services/domain model View -What the user sees and can interact with. Presentation of data. MVVM- The view is active, has a knowledge of model. The view in this model contains behaviors, events, and data bindings because it has knowledge of the model and viewmodel. MVC stands for Model View Controller. It work as follows: the model updates the view that the user sees. The user then can use the view to interact with controller functions. Then the controller manipulates the model.

    10. What is the difference between a service and a factory? Factories are functions that return the object, while services are constructor functions of the object which are instantiated with the new keyword.
